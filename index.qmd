::: {#me}
Welcome to my personal website that I built with R Studio— I'm Nick Strezo, an undergraduate student at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. I'm majoring in Economics with minors in Data Science and Spanish, and I'm also a proud member of the Macalester Baseball Team.

Originally from San Mateo, California, I’ve always been someone who enjoys taking on challenges, whether that’s on the baseball field or in the classroom. As a member of the Macalester College Varsity Baseball Team and a former CIF CCS Pitcher of the Year, I’ve learned the value of discipline, perseverance, and leadership in high-pressure environments. These same qualities have guided me through my academic pursuits and professional experiences.

Outside of academics and athletics, I’ve worked in a variety of roles that have helped me grow as both a leader and a team player. From serving as an Assistant Manager at Starting Lineup Baseball  where I scheduled facility operations and supported athlete development to coaching youth baseball at Stanford Athletics and contributing to preschool remodeling projects, I’ve developed a strong foundation in communication, project coordination, and community engagement.

Through my coursework and hands-on experiences, I’ve built skills in R, Python, statistics, and Microsoft Office, and I look forward to applying them in meaningful, real-world contexts.

Thanks for visiting my site — feel free to explore more about my background, experiences, and projects!
