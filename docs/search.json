    "text": "Hi! Welcome to my personal website — I’m Nick Strezo, an undergraduate student at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. I’m majoring in Economics with minors in Data Science and Spanish, and I’m also a proud member of the Macalester Baseball Team.\nOriginally from San Mateo, California, I’ve always been someone who enjoys taking on challenges, whether that’s on the baseball field or in the classroom. As a member of the Macalester College Varsity Baseball Team and a former CIF CCS Pitcher of the Year, I’ve learned the value of discipline, perseverance, and leadership in high-pressure environments. These same qualities have guided me through my academic pursuits and professional experiences.\nOutside of academics and athletics, I’ve worked in a variety of roles that have helped me grow as both a leader and a team player. From serving as an Assistant Manager at Starting Lineup Baseball where I scheduled facility operations and supported athlete development to coaching youth baseball at Stanford Athletics and contributing to preschool remodeling projects, I’ve developed a strong foundation in communication, project coordination, and community engagement.\nThrough my coursework and hands-on experiences, I’ve built skills in R, Python, statistics, and Microsoft Office, and I look forward to applying them in meaningful, real-world contexts.\nThanks for visiting my site — feel free to explore more about my background, experiences, and interests!\n\n\n\nMacalester College (St. Paul Minnesota)\n\n\nHillsdale High School (San Mateo California)\nknitr::include_graphics(“img/IMG_0310.jpeg”)"
